# DISCLAIMER
This system is directly taken from [Trelamium Two](https://github.com/itswymsical/TrelamiumTwo/tree/new-main/Core/Mechanics/Particles), which I have written myself a few years ago.

This system is nowhere close to being as efficient and performant as I want it to be, however, I have made the decision to use it temporarily due to time optimization. Soon enough, a new particle system will be introduced, with much better optimizations and efficiency.
